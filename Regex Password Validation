You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a digit
only contains alphanumeric characters (note that '_' is not alphanumeric)


//Solution
// assign your RegExp to REGEXP:
const REGEXP = /^(?=.*[a-z]) (?=.*[A-Z]) (?=.*\d) [A-Za-z0-9]{6,}$/;


Explaination 

^ … $ → anchors (make sure the whole string is checked).

(?=.*[a-z]) → lookahead: ensures at least one lowercase.

(?=.*[A-Z]) → lookahead: ensures at least one uppercase.

(?=.*\d) → lookahead: ensures at least one digit.

[A-Za-z0-9]{6,} → only alphanumeric characters allowed, minimum 6 length.
